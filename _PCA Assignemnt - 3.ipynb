    "**Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: In linear algebra, given a square matrix \\( A \\), an eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) and its corresponding eigenvector \\( v \\) satisfy the relation \\( Av = \\lambda v \\). This means that when matrix \\( A \\) is applied to vector \\( v \\), the result is a scalar multiple of \\( v \\), defined by \\( \\lambda \\). \n",
    "- **Eigen-Decomposition**: This is the process of decomposing a square matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. A matrix \\( A \\) can be written as \\( PDP^{-1} \\), where \\( P \\) is a matrix with the eigenvectors of \\( A \\) as its columns, \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of \\( A \\) on its diagonal, and \\( P^{-1} \\) is the inverse of \\( P \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Suppose \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\). To find its eigenvalues, we calculate the characteristic polynomial \\( \\det(A - \\lambda I) \\), where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. For this matrix, the eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda_1 = 5 \\), \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\). Using these eigenvalues, we can find the eigenvectors, leading to the eigen-decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?**\n",
    "- **Eigen Decomposition**: This is the process of decomposing a square matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, allowing the representation of the original matrix in terms of these fundamental components. If a square matrix \\( A \\) can be decomposed into eigenvectors and eigenvalues, it can be written as \\( PDP^{-1} \\), where \\( P \\) is the matrix of eigenvectors and \\( D \\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\n",
    "- **Significance**: Eigen decomposition provides insights into the properties of matrices, including their stability, invertibility, and determinants. It is also used in various mathematical and engineering applications, including solving differential equations, analyzing systems dynamics, and performing transformations in computer graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.**\n",
    "- **Conditions for Diagonalization**: A square matrix is diagonalizable if it has enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis for the entire vector space. This typically requires that the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue matches its geometric multiplicity.\n",
    "- **Proof Outline**: \n",
    "  - For a square matrix \\( A \\) of order \\( n \\), let \\( \\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_k \\) be the distinct eigenvalues.\n",
    "  - The algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue is the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial.\n",
    "  - The geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue.\n",
    "  - If, for each eigenvalue, the geometric multiplicity matches the algebraic multiplicity, then \\( A \\) has enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis, making it diagonalizable.\n",
    "  - Thus, if the sum of the geometric multiplicities of all eigenvalues is equal to \\( n \\), the matrix can be diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "- **Spectral Theorem**: This theorem states that any symmetric matrix can be diagonalized using its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It provides a strong foundation for understanding the eigen-decomposition of symmetric matrices.\n",
    "- **Relation to Diagonalizability**: The spectral theorem guarantees that symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable, with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. This theorem simplifies many linear algebraic processes, enabling reliable decomposition and transformation.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  Consider a symmetric matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\). According to the spectral theorem, \\( A \\) can be diagonalized. By finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can represent \\( A \\) in a diagonalized form, confirming the theorem's validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix, and what do they represent?**\n",
    "- **Finding Eigenvalues**: To find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\( A \\), compute the characteristic polynomial and determine its roots. The characteristic polynomial is given by \\( \\det(A - \\lambda I) \\), where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues.\n",
    "- **What Eigenvalues Represent**: Eigenvalues indicate the scale factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or compressed when the matrix transformation is applied. They can reveal insights into matrix stability, invertibility, and dynamic system behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What are eigenvectors, and how are they related to eigenvalues?**\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors**: These are the vectors that, when a matrix transformation is applied, are stretched or compressed without changing their direction. They are associated with eigenvalues, representing the amount of scaling during transformation.\n",
    "- **Relation to Eigenvalues**: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related by the characteristic equation \\( Av = \\lambda v \\). The eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) represents the scaling factor, while the eigenvector \\( v \\) indicates the direction that remains constant during transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "- **Geometric Interpretation**: Eigenvectors represent the fixed directions in a linear transformation, while eigenvalues represent the factors by which these directions are stretched or compressed.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  Consider a matrix transformation \\( A \\) applied to an eigenvector \\( v \\). The result is a new vector that is parallel to \\( v \\), scaled by the corresponding eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\). This fixed directionality suggests that eigenvectors represent invariant directions under transformation, with eigenvalues indicating the scaling magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?**\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA uses eigen decomposition to identify the most significant directions in a dataset, enabling dimensionality reduction and data compression.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "- **Multiple Sets of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**: A square matrix has a unique set of eigenvalues, but eigenvectors may not be unique if the matrix has repeated eigenvalues or degeneracy. This results from eigenvectors' geometric multiplicity being greater than one.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  A diagonal matrix with repeated eigenvalues can have multiple linearly independent eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue, providing different bases for the eigenspace.\n",
    "\n",
